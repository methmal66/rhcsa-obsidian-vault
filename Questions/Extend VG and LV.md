We are working on /data initially the size is 2GB. The /dev/test0/lvtestvolume is mount on /data. Now you required more space on /data but you already added all physical volumes belongs to the disk. You saw that you have unallocated space around 5 GB on your hard disk. Increase the size of lvtestvolume by 5GB.
