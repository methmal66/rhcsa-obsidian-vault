# rhcsa-obsidian-vault 
An obsidian vault containing my personal notes to prepare for the Red Hat RHCSA(RHEL9) exam. These notes are highly integrated with Obsidian. Using them outside of the software will not make any sense. I will grow and maintain this vault until i take the exam. So, make sure to do frequent git pulls. Remember to merge when pulling changes (Otherwise, your flashcard metadata and own notes will be erased).

# Final thoughts
> Reading someone else's notes won't cut it for effective studying. Remembering and understanding concepts don't hinge on the number of times you read them; it's all about the effort you put into crafting your own notes.
   The magic lies in the cognitive stress you embrace while jotting down a concept using your own words, deconstructing it into bite-sized chunks, and questioning beyond the obvious. Embrace the patterns, organize, evolve, and enrich your notes over time, and don't forget to doodle diagrams!
   This process is the gateway to a deeper grasp of the material. The understanding you gain effortlessly becomes etched in your memory. That is the essence of note-taking.
